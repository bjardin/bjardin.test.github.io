          <h2 class="section-heading">My Life</h2>
          <p>I grew up being such the most unorganized kid. I couldn’t read until when I was seven.  I had two tutors gave up on me because I cannot process things on my head. I couldn’t even spell my name right. Can you imagine that? Realizing this mess, I doubled my efforts to catch up with my classmates. 
          A year after, several things happened: <br>
          
          <ul>
              <li>I started to excel in school, especially in Math and English.</li>
              <li>My Dad left us on New Year’s Eve.</li>
              <li>Yo-Yoing was introduced to me.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p></p>

          <p></p>

          <p></p>

          <p></p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">My Career</h2>

          <p>You are probably here because you want to know more about me, especially on my career.</p>

          <p>I was 11 when I got my first gig as a salesman and demonstrator. My role is to visit 12-15 malls on the weekend to demonstrate and sell yo-yos. Me as a kid, I don’t know what to do with my salary, so I just save a little bit for myself so I can eat out, and give the rest to my mom. </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">During those years, I learned how to market myself and buy & sell products. I market myself so I can get some gigs on the top of my weekend work, and sell some of my toys so I can buy more toys. </blockquote>

          <p>Then high school came. I was distracted. Dating, online games, friends, yo-yo career, gigs and school.  It is so hard to prioritize things. Being a teenager, you need more than just school allowance. So I have to do more gigs and buy & sell my toys so I have budget on my dating and life adventures.</p>

          <p>I went to Engineering school, and dropped out when I was in my third year. That year is the biggest decision I have to make. It’s depressing and probably I'm at the lowest state of my life. It’s the time I have to decide whether to stay in the Philippines with my family, friends, girlfriend and finish my Engineering degree or accept the once in a lifetime opportunity and relocate in the USA.</p>

          <p>Fast forward now, I think I made the right decision. My girlfriend is now my wife, and we are both in USA! I didn’t pursue my Engineering degree because I realized that I’ve been doing sales and marketing for such a long time, and I feel like this is my destiny. </p>
          
          <p> I’m very talkative -- I forgot you are here because you want to know more about my career! So here it goes. </p>

          <p> I work for Duncan Toys, a division of Flambeau Incorporated. Duncan has many toy categories and a huge chunk of my work goes to high-end yo-yos, which supports the niche market and front-end of Duncan. It’s the front-end because the niche market of yo-yoing is the community. This is where we develop our cross-generation fans, word of mouth and organic marketing. Aside from the high-end products, I manage our ecommerce business, flagship stores, email marketing and events. I have been working with Duncan Toys for about 9 years. Here is the breakdown:

              <ul>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Yo-Yo Life</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
